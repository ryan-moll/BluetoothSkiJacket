## Summary
+ This project is a ski jacket that contains sensors which allow the user to see if they have suitable skiing form via a companion app.
+ The jacket hardware was done using an Arduino. See the related code and schematics in the [./Arduino](https://github.com/ryan-moll/BluetoothSkiJacket/tree/master/Arduino "Arduino folder") folder.

+ The app was created using Swift in xCode. That code can be found in the [./Main](https://github.com/ryan-moll/BluetoothSkiJacket/tree/master/Main "Main folder") folder.
+ All app design, UI, UX, graphics, and technical programming was done by me. Much of the base code I built upon was courtesy of RickRedStix.

## Results
+ Photos and video of the jacket and app can be found in the [./Results](https://github.com/ryan-moll/BluetoothSkiJacket/tree/master/Results "Results folder") folder.
